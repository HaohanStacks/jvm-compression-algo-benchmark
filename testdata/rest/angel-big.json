The main goal and driving force  was a desire to improve on what was already available in the social media market. Our second goal was to offer a learning tool with potential applications in high school and university environments. The last and the most important, was to build on existing technologies to provide more accurate, direct and private exchange of information, if you like. What really excites us, is the possibility to offer an interface with greater user side customisation (which fall within our terms of use conditions).\n\nOur new tool/application design process dictates that after designing a new tool, we first need to finish the tool and test if our new tool works and provides real user side benefits before release.\n\nWe like the idea of \u200b\u200btrying to outdo the competition.
