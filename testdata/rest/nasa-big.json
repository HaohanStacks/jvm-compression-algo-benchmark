The Project suspended operations of the FUV camera following an electrical overcurrent in May 2009. GALEX data products include a series of all sky surveys and deep sky surveys in the imaging mode, and partial surveys in the near and far UV spectroscopic modes. The principal imaging studies are the Nearby Galaxy Survey (NGS), Deep (DIS), Medium (MIS), and All Sky Imaging Surveys (AIS). A somewhat smaller grism (spectroscopic) survey is also included. More details on each survey can be found in Chapter 2 of the GALEX technical documentation page. Although originally planned as a 29-month mission, past NASA Senior Senior Review Panels have recommended mission extensions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>During the course of the mission, the GALEX team have released data to the public through MAST at discrete times. The last complete release was the GR6 (late 2010 through mid 2011 for imaging supplements and the grism survey). A final release of GALEX data arrived in late 2012 at MAST. These included a number of redelivered GR6 data (additional visits and associated coadds from 2003 onwards), along with new tiles within GR7, which span approximately from Jan. 2010 through Feb. 2012. This data will be made available through the various MAST search tools by Feb. 2013. The GALEX catalog of discrete sources, &#8220;GCAT&#8221;, will be made available through MAST at a later date. Various documentation, analysis tools, and new data products (potentially including the photon list files) are planned for 2013 and beyond, so continue to look for new data and analysis tools within MAST.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"From its launch into low-Earth orbit on April 28, 2003 the GALEX NUV camera operated almost continuously.

This object is a two-dimensional array of an Equidistant Cylindrical (also known as Platte Carre) projection of the globe. The values can be stored as bytes, 2-byte integers, or 4- byte floats. The first two are scaled real values and may be converted projected to geophysical values using the global attributes Scaling, Scaling Equation, Base, Slope, and Intercept.<\/p>\n<p>The standard SMI products are generated from binned data products, one for each of the following geophysical parameters: chlorophyll a concentration, angstrom coefficient, normalized water-leaving radiance at each visible wavelength, aerosol optical thickness, epsilon, and diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm. For MODIS, products are generated for sea surface temperature (SST), 4 micron SST (SST4) and nighttime SST (NSST). Thus, each SMI product represents data binned over the period covered by the parent product. The arithmetic mean is used in each case to obtain the values for the SMI grid points from the binned data products.
